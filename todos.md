## Further Development and Testing

### Development
There are some limitations in the application and need to be improved. In addition, some other features can be added to have more useful application.
- The values of the parameters have varying scale. From that reason, the scatter plot on the map is not optimal, when the size was defined by the values. It makes sense to have some separated map plots for each parameter
- Create routing for the application, which has one route for map and one for stacked bar plot 
- Have more organized information on the hover box

### Testing
In this application, there are no testing features included. Since the application is quite simple, the tests should be more focused on the api call.

- Test the api responses
- Test the data structure 
- Test the missing values in the data
- Unit test applied on the functions
